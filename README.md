# üçÖTomato bulk RNA-seq GRN and TDA analysis

From the multi-transcriptomics bulk RNA-seq data, we applied [HIVE](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.04.583290). The conditions represents tomato infected with 7 different conditions (*Meloidogyne incognita* 7 and 14 dpi, *Botrytis cinerea*, *Phytophthora infestans*, *Cladosporium fulvum*, and *Potato spindle tuber viroid* mild and severe strains). Representing a total of 83 samples across 7 infections.
The data are publicaly available throught their respective bioproject:

 HIVE returned a list of genes available in the data folder but the following framework can be applied to any gene list.
From the list, we retrieved the GRN using **TomTom** neo4j database. We further curate the GRN to have a balance between confidence and sparsity.

We used decoupleR's ULM to infer TF activities and retrieve the significant ones. We consider the previous GRN and t-stat output of DESeq2 perform on each infection independently.
The analysis resulted in 43 significant regulatory TFs out of the 71 present in the GRN. We then used decoupleR's MLM to infer pathways activities from KEGG pathways (also available using TomTom).

Topological Data Analysis was also performed on the same GRN with corresponding TF activities. We first applied the mapper algorithm to find a simpler representation of the GRN, and we further used the Tomato algorithm to find groups on the simply network.

Order to run the framework:
You need the HIVE selection present in Data/

From the raw transcriptomics table:
`DEA/DEA.R` to perform the DEA and get every stat needed. Then `DEA/Merge_matrix.ipynb` to get the merged data used after.

GRN and Activities:
`GRN.ipynb` to retrieve the necessary networks (GRN and KEGG) from TomTom and check them.
`TF_activity_tstat.ipynb` to perform TF and pathway activites.

TDA: 
`TDA/Prepare_data.ipynb` to format the data for TDA.
`TDA/mapper.py` to obtain the TDA network colored for all pathogens and `TDA/mapper_two.py` to obtain the four configuration.
Finally, `TDA/Hub_TDA.ipynb` to detect hub in each of the configuration and `TDA/Pathway_acts_hubs.ipynb` to check for pathways activity in the sub-GRN of the hubs. 

For the plots, most of them are obtain with `Plot/Plot_clean.ipynb` and at the end of `TDA/plots.ipynb`

NB: gudhi package must be changed to have the correct plot :
`miniconda3/envs/{ENV_NAME}/lib/python3.1/site-packages/gudhi` and `cover_complex.py` the original `np.mean` from the fit method of the CoverComplexPy class must be change to `np.nanmean`.
